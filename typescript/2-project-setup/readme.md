<h4>Installing Live Server </h4>
- run > npm init <br>

    --save-dev: This flag indicates that the package should be installed as a development dependency
    
    live-server is a simple, lightweight development server with live reloading capability. It serves your static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) and automatically refreshes the browser whenever changes are detected in those files. This is particularly useful when building web applications or websites, as it provides a more dynamic development experience.
