    <h3>Full Stack Web Development</h3>
    <p>Full Stack Web Development refers to the development of both the front end (client side) and the back end (server side) of a web application. A full stack developer has the skills required to create a complete web application, from designing the user interface to handling the server and database.</p>
    
    <h4>Types of Full Stack Development</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Front-end Development:</strong> Involves creating the visual components of a website or application, including the layout, design, and interaction. Technologies include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.</li>
        <li><strong>Back-end Development:</strong> Focuses on the server-side logic, database management, and API integration. Technologies include languages and frameworks like Node.js, Express, .NET, Django, and databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Frontend Technologies</h4>
    <p>Frontend development is centered around building the user interface and experience. Common technologies used include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML:</strong> The standard markup language for creating web pages.</li>
        <li id="css"><strong>CSS:</strong> Stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> A programming language that enables interactive web pages.</li>
        <li><strong>React:</strong> A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Angular:</strong> A TypeScript-based framework developed by Google for building web applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Vue.js:</strong> A progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Backend Technologies</h4>
    <p>Backend development is focused on server-side logic, databases, and integration of front-end elements with the back-end system. Common technologies include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li id="Node"><strong>Node.js:</strong> A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, allowing for server-side scripting.</li>
        <li><strong>Express.js:</strong> A web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.</li>
        <li><strong>MongoDB:</strong> A NoSQL database that uses JSON-like documents with schema, known for its scalability and flexibility.</li>
        <li><strong>MySQL:</strong> An open-source relational database management system based on Structured Query Language (SQL).</li>
        <li><strong>.NET:</strong> A software framework developed by Microsoft, used for building a wide range of applications, including web applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Django:</strong> A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The MERN Stack</h4>
    <p>The MERN stack is a popular full-stack development approach that includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li id="Mongo"><strong>MongoDB:</strong> A NoSQL database used to store application data in a flexible, JSON-like format.</li>
        <li><strong>Express.js:</strong> A web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.</li>
        <li><strong>React:</strong> A front-end library developed by Facebook, used for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Node.js:</strong> A JavaScript runtime that allows for executing JavaScript on the server, used for building scalable and high-performance applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Full Stack Developer Responsibilities</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Designing and developing front-end web architecture.</li>
        <li>Building and maintaining back-end services and database management.</li>
        <li>Ensuring cross-platform optimization for mobile devices.</li>
        <li>Creating and managing APIs for integration with other services.</li>
        <li>Collaborating with other team members and stakeholders.</li>
    </ul>
