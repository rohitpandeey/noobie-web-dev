if we want to set favicon icon we can do it following ways 
#1 name your image file as favicon.ico - here it will apply automatically without using link:favicon 
#2 using  <link rel="shortcut " href="smily.png" type="image/x-icon">icon

#Linking Partiular Element to Navigation bar 
Step 1 Give id to tag you want to navigate to eg id="Node"
        <li id="Node"><strong>Node.js:</strong> A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, allowing for server-side scripting.</li>

Step 2 create one anchor tag and pass id in href
    <a href="#Node">Node js</a>

#Directing user to Top

method 1 reloads the page and take user to Top
<a href="">go to top</a>

method 2 take user to top without reloading, here we write hash "#" because of which when clicked on go to top it try to search for given id from top and finds none so in result we reach top of website
<a href="#">go to top</a>
